# CLAUDE.md

Google Apps Script project for extracting Incident IQ (iiQ) asset data into Google Sheets for reporting and replacement cycle planning. Designed for school district IT teams tracking Chromebooks, laptops, and other devices.

## Architecture

```
iiQ API  →  Google Apps Script  →  Google Sheets  →  Looker Studio / Power BI
             (scripts/*.gs)        (raw data +        (dashboards)
                                    formula analytics)
```

**Data Flow:**
1. Reference data loads first (locations, status types)
2. Bulk asset search (paginated, fast) with checkpoint resume
3. Formula columns calculate derived metrics (age, warranty status)
4. Analytics sheets auto-calculate via Google Sheets formulas
5. Daily incremental refresh keeps data current via ModifiedDate filter

**★ = default sheets** created by Setup Spreadsheet. Non-starred sheets are optional.

**Regeneration:** Analytics setup functions use `getOrCreateSheet` -- on regeneration, only the formula is refreshed (no delete/create/reformat). Formulas are live and auto-recalculate when AssetData changes; regeneration is only needed after code updates.

## API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/v1.0/assets?$p={page}&$s={size}` | POST | Bulk asset search with filters (deleted assets excluded by default) |
| `/v2.0/locations/all?$s=1000` | GET | Location directory |
| `/v1.0/assets/status/types?$s=100` | GET | Asset status types |
| `/v1.0/sites/roles` | GET | Site roles (for STUDENT_ROLE_ID) |
| `/v1.0/users?$s=1` | POST | User count by filters (enrollment) |
| `/v1.0/users/{userId}/activities` | GET | Per-user activity log — filtered client-side for asset assignment events (IndividualLookup) |

## Config Sheet Keys

Required:
- `API_BASE_URL`: iiQ instance URL (e.g., `https://district.incidentiq.com`) — `/api` added automatically
- `BEARER_TOKEN`: JWT authentication token

Optional:
- `SITE_ID`: Site UUID (multi-site instances)
- `PAGE_SIZE`: Records per API call (default 100)
- `THROTTLE_MS`: Delay between requests (default 1000)
- `ASSET_BATCH_SIZE`: Assets per page for bulk load (default 500)
- `REPLACEMENT_AGE_YEARS`: Device age threshold for replacement planning (default 4)
- `NEXT_SCHOOL_YEAR_START`: Target date for replacement planning (default 2026-07-01, format YYYY-MM-DD)

Progress Tracking (auto-managed):
- `ASSET_LAST_PAGE`, `ASSET_TOTAL_PAGES`, `ASSET_COMPLETE`: Load progress
- `LAST_REFRESH_DATE`: ISO timestamp of last incremental refresh

Version Information (auto-managed):
- `SCRIPT_VERSION`: Installed script version (from `SCRIPT_VERSION` constant in `Config.gs`)
- `LATEST_VERSION`: Latest available version from GitHub, with status text and color-coded cell (green = current, yellow = update available)
- `VERSION_CHECK_DATE`: Date of last successful version check

**Version Check:** Scripts check GitHub daily for newer versions (piggybacked on `triggerDataContinue` — only fires if `isVersionCheckStale()` returns true, i.e. last check was >24h ago). Fetches `version.json` from the repo's `main` branch via raw.githubusercontent.com. Results land in the Config sheet with color coding — no pop-up dialogs. Manual check via **iiQ Assets > Setup > Check for Updates**. The version-check code fails silently if GitHub is unreachable — it must never break data operations.

Telemetry (on by default for new installs — required for automated polling):
- `TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: `TRUE` by default on new Setup Spreadsheet runs. Set to `FALSE` to opt out of telemetry **and** disable automated polling.

The endpoint URL is a maintainer decision, not a district setting — it lives as a hardcoded `TELEMETRY_URL` constant at the top of `Config.gs`. Blank until the server is deployed; `reportTelemetry()` is a no-op while it's blank.

**Telemetry wiring (v1.3.0+):** All logic lives in `scripts/Telemetry.gs`, copied from the shared client at `iiq-sheets-telemetry/client/Telemetry.gs`. Three entry points:
- `reportTelemetry()` — called at the tail of every trigger handler. Posts a JSON payload to `TELEMETRY_URL`. Self-gates on `TELEMETRY_URL` / `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` / trigger presence / `API_BASE_URL`. Best-effort; never throws.
- `enforceTelemetryGate()` — called as the first line of every trigger handler. If `TELEMETRY_ENABLED != TRUE`, uninstalls every time-based (CLOCK) trigger and returns `false`. Edit / open triggers (e.g. IndividualLookup) are preserved.
- `assertTelemetryEnabledForTriggers()` — called at the top of `setupAutomatedTriggers()`. Throws a user-readable error (surfaced in a dialog) if telemetry is off, so Setup Automated Triggers installs nothing in that state.

Payload (schemaVersion 1): `{schemaVersion, installId, project, version, instanceUrl, installedAt, scriptTimeZone, sentAt, rowCount, primarySheet, analyticsSheets}`. `instanceUrl` is the hostname portion of `API_BASE_URL` (e.g. `demo.incidentiq.com`) — iiQ owns the customer relationship, so direct identification is the correct model. No PII, no asset content, no credentials. `installId` is a stable UUID in `PropertiesService` under `TELEMETRY_INSTALL_ID`; `TELEMETRY_INSTALLED_AT` is stamped on first telemetry run. Server-side rate limiting (5 min) and dedupe (~6 h per install/project/day) replace client-side throttling — no `TELEMETRY_LAST_SENT` row.

Server lives in the sibling workspace directory `iiq-sheets-telemetry/`.

## Data Loading

**Initial Load — Bulk Asset Search:**
- POST `/v1.0/assets` with empty filters, paginated
- 5.5-minute timeout with page-level checkpoints
- `triggerDataContinue` resumes across invocations

**Incremental Refresh — ModifiedDate Filter:**
- POST `/v1.0/assets` with `modifieddate` facet filter (`date>=YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Finds existing rows by AssetId and updates in-place
- Appends new assets not previously seen
- Runs daily at 3 AM via trigger, also available on-demand from menu

**After loading:** `applyAssetFormulas()` adds ARRAYFORMULA calculated columns AE-AG.

## Initial Setup

1. Create a new Google Spreadsheet
2. Extensions > Apps Script → copy all `.gs` files
3. Save and refresh
4. **iiQ Assets > Setup > Setup Spreadsheet**
5. Fill in Config sheet (API_BASE_URL, BEARER_TOKEN)
6. **iiQ Assets > Setup > Verify Configuration**
7. **iiQ Assets > Asset Data > Load / Resume Assets** (auto-loads reference data, then starts assets)
8. **iiQ Assets > Setup > Setup Automated Triggers** (automation finishes loading + applies formulas)

## Trigger Schedule

| Function | Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `triggerDataContinue` | Every 10 min | Resume interrupted initial load |
| `triggerDailyRefresh` | Daily 3 AM | Incremental refresh (ModifiedDate filter) |
| `triggerWeeklyFullRefresh` | Sunday 2 AM | Full reload + reference data refresh |
